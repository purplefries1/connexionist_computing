# Multi-Layer Perceptron from Scratch (python)
## The project
Implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) built from scratch with Python and NumPy without any machine learning libraries.

This coding/research project was developed for the course COMP 30230 – Connectionist Computing.

The goal of this project was to understand how neural networks learn by implementing:
- Forward propagation
- Backpropagation
- Gradient
- Weight updates and initialisation strategies

Two tasks:
XOR Classification
Approximation of the function sin(𝑥1 − 𝑥2 + 𝑥3 − 𝑥4 ).
